# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, since good loans outnumber risky loans easily. The purpose of this project is to use different machine learning concepts to predict credit risk using the credict card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, by employing various techniques for training and evaluating models having unbalanced classes. As a result of this we are required to use **imbalanced-learn** and **scikit-learn** python libraries to build and evaluate the following models using resampling:

- Oversampling the data using the **RandomOverSampler** and **SMOTE** algorithms.
- Undersampling the data using the **ClusterCentroids** algorithm.
- Oversampling and Undersampling the data via the combinational approach using the **SMOTEENN** algorithm.
- Comparing two machine learning models that reduce bias, **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier**, for making credict risk predictions. 

## Results

This section of the project focuses on the results achieved for the RandomOverSampler Model, SMOTE Model, ClusterCentroids Model, BalancedRandomForestClassifier, EasyEnsembleClassifier. The results achieved are in terms of:

- Balanced accuracy score
- Precision
- Recall scores
